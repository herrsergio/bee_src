This is V2.0 of the RHINO simulator (early alpha stage).

The simulator has been rewritten nearly from scratch.
Changes since last release:

- The Display is implemeted using Athena-Widgets plus a Drawing-Widget,
  instead of Easy-X.
- You can navigate through the playground using scrollbars.
- Playground dimensions are given in cm
  (absolute position of lower left and upper right point).
  No more distance calculations in pixels !
- We allow negative coordinates. This makes conversion of VRML scenes
  into a simulator map easier.
- Additional command line option -view.
  This starts the simulator as a pure viewer,
  displaying the robots track given by BASE.
  (Using this mode the simulator connects to BASE as "VIEWER")

Things missing from the last release:

- Sonar simulation is not yet complete.
  The simulator always gives the exact distances and
  doesen't respect total reflections.
- No Help message yet.
- No save method yet.
