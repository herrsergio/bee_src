o stderr of console to window. Might be possible

o on the notebooks some info stuff, like PID, running time or
  whatever

o maybe: user clicked on start foo => switch to output window foo.

o maybe hookup stdin to the textwindow, so that users can 
  enter something. probably too difficult.

o a little button, that clears all, some or one textwindow.

Revision 1.5  1998/02/09 22:59:28  swa
Added a parameter that controls if we automatically scroll to the end of
each log window.

Revision 1.4  1997/11/29 00:57:59  swa
Changed documentation to reflect console.ini and ssh stuff.

Revision 1.3  1997/11/29 00:13:09  swa
Moved all stuff from console.ini into beeSoft.ini. Moved console2.ini to console.ini.
Consider other definitions in beeSoft.ini if programOnHost is `***', so that exisiting
definitions are re-used.

Revision 1.2  1997/11/28 18:26:00  swa
Added a variable to replace absolute paths. More user friendly. Use only
ssh for simplicity and security. Update TODO with tyson's thoughts.

Revision 1.1.1.1  1997/11/10 23:10:36  swa
Stefan's new console manager.

Revision 1.5  1997/11/09 18:25:10  swa
All programs and their dependencies are now taken care of. A second,
user-specific ini file was added, console2.ini. All dependencies in
console.ini should eventually go into beeSoft.ini and console2.ini
should be renamed console.ini.

Revision 1.4  1997/11/08 23:36:23  swa
All dependent processes get started. Also on remote machines. beeSoft
current processes and their dependencies are coded in console.ini.
